# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for transforming the existing forum system into a comprehensive Helpdesk Ticketing and Support System. The system will enable users to submit support tickets, track their progress, and allow administrators to manage and resolve customer issues efficiently. The system will maintain the same technical stack (HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, PHP, MySQL) and complexity level as the current forum project.
